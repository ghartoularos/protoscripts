#I had separate markers targeting CD45RA and RO (different isoforms) but because these will have similar transcripts (some just missing a
#few exons) I decided to just look for CD45 generally. Both isoforms will be found when searching the coding transcripts.
#I have different transcripts for CD3 subunits. 
#Changed TIM3 (CD366) to HAVCR2 because CD366 not found at the uniprot website cd list.
#I incorporated some band-aid fixes by manually searching the UniProt website.
